#Android Play Ground:

Android play ground is a collection of apps. Each application will demosntrate an android/java related concept. I will try to keep all related code in one file, most of the time it will be inside MainActivity.java. Sometime this may be against best practice but the goal is to keep it simple and only focus on one concept per project. 

###SimpleThreadDemo:
